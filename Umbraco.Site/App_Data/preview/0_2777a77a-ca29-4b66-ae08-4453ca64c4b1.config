      <bodyText><![CDATA[<p><span>Campbell Nash delivers fresh, fast and iterative programmes of work that deliver the maximum business benefit in the shortest time.</span></p>
<p><span><span>We exist to do business consultancy with a technical slant and we work with department heads and senior managers to identify and solve business problems.</span></span></p>
<p>We focus on business needs first and then find the right way to meet them. We’re proud of our technical expertise but we’re not driven by it. In fact, about 80% of what we do is peopleware and only about 20% is software.</p>
<p>Typical projects range from a couple of weeks with one full-time consultant to a larger team working for two or three months. We prefer shorter projects that deliver rapid results.</p>
<p><strong>All our projects follow our Business Process Optimisation methodology (BPO)</strong><span> which includes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fact-finding.</strong> What problems are you trying to solve?</li>
<li><strong>Strategy. </strong>What is the right mix of peopleware, process and technology?</li>
<li><strong>Implementation.</strong> Redesigning processes, workflows, IT systems.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge transfer. </strong>Making sure that you can continue after we stop.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We have lots of experience with Microsoft technology, including SharePoint, but we are vendor agnostic. We have no axe to grind. We want what works best for you.</strong></p>

<p><strong>European customers embrace Windows 8.</strong> During the past year we’ve been talking about what Windows 8 <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/windows/b/business/archive/2012/08/01/what-windows-8-rtm-means-for-businesses.aspx">means for businesses</a>. Now that <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2012/10/25/windows-reimagined-windows8.aspx">Windows 8 is officially available</a> across the globe, <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/windows/b/business/archive/2012/11/05/businesses-find-new-opportunities-with-windows-8-apps.aspx">so many of our customers</a> are seeing first-hand how Windows 8 can benefit their organizations. Last Wednesday, Windows Commercial Senior Director of Business Planning Erwin Visser reported from Europe where he heard from several businesses using Windows 8. In this Nov. 13 <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/windows/b/business/archive/2012/11/13/european-customers-embrace-windows-8.aspx">Windows for your Business post</a>, Erwin highlights a few favorite Windows 8 business adoption stories from Europe. And don’t miss Erwin’s <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/windows/b/business/archive/2012/11/19/emirates-airline-serves-up-new-inflight-experiences-with-windows-8.aspx">post from Dubai</a> from Monday, featuring Emirates airline.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Azure SQL Database named an Enterprise Cloud Database Leader by Forrester Research. </strong>In the latest in a series of Windows Azure <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/">good news</a>, Forrester Research Inc. has positioned Microsoft as a Leader in The Forrester Wave: Enterprise Cloud Databases, Q4 2012. In the report posted<a href="http://www.forrester.com/pimages/rws/reprints/document/70541/oid/1-LLP641">here</a>, Microsoft received the highest scores of any vendor in Current Offering and Market Presence. Forrester describes its rigorous and lengthy Wave process: “To evaluate the vendors and their products against our set of criteria, we gather details of product qualifications through a combination of lab evaluations, questionnaires, demos, and/or discussions with client references.” <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2012/11/14/windows-azure-sql-database-named-an-enterprise-cloud-database-leader-by-forrester-research.aspx">Read the summary here</a>, including examples of customers who are taking advantage of the very Azure benefits Forrester identifies.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Azure benchmarks show top performance for big compute. </strong>Windows Azure now offers customers a cloud platform that can cost effectively and reliably meet the needs of Big Compute. With a massively powerful and scalable infrastructure, new instance configurations, and a new HPC Pack 2012, Windows Azure is designed to be the best platform for your Big Compute applications. In fact, we tested and validated the power of Windows Azure for Big Compute applications by running the LINPACK benchmark. The network performance was so impressive — 151.3 TFlops on 8,065 cores with 90.2 percent efficiency — that we submitted the results and have been certified as one of the <a href="http://www.top500.org/lists/2012/11/">Top 500</a> of the world’s largest supercomputers. For the rest of the story, head over to this <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2012/11/13/windows-azure-benchmarks-show-top-performance-for-big-compute.aspx">Nov. 13 post</a> on the Windows Azure blog.</p>
<p><strong>Sonos, The xx and Kinect create a musical immersion.</strong> The <a href="http://blog.sonos.com/cool-music-news/the-xx-transforms-the-sonos-studio-with-an-interactive-installation/">Sonos Studio</a> in Los Angeles is currently hosting an exhibition titled “Missing” in collaboration with <a href="http://thexx.info/">The xx</a>, media producer Aramique Krauthamer, media artist <a href="http://kylemcdonald.net/">Kyle McDonald</a> and engineer Matt Mets. The exhibition features 50 robotic Sonos <a href="http://www.sonos.com/shop/products/play3">PLAY:3’s</a>(image below) that follow the movement of visitors as they pass through the space. How do the players follow the guests? You guessed it, with Kinect.

<p><strong>Enabling great Play To experiences from your Windows 8 apps – and websites!</strong> The “Play To” feature allows you to stream music, photos and videos from apps to Xbox and other supported devices on your home network. Imagine being able to easily flick photos and videos from your app to the big screen TV (like in the image below). Or music from your app to your living room speakers. Using the Play To contract, you can easily enable those scenarios for your users from your apps. It’s a great way for you to make your apps more engaging in users’ living rooms. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsappdev/archive/2012/11/16/enabling-great-play-to-experiences-from-your-windows-8-apps-and-websites.aspx">Get the scoop</a> on what Play To is, when to use it and how to use it, plus a load of resources to get you started on the Windows 8 developer blog.</p>]]></uBlogsyContentBody>

                <uBlogsyContentBody><![CDATA[<p class="BasicParagraph">The warning has been issued by Campbell Nash, the Glasgow based Technical Business Consultancy which builds compliance applications such as Due Diligence solutions and Gifts &amp; Entertainment registers, to help organisations fully comply with the influx of new legislation, such as the UK’s new Anti-Bribery and Corruption Act.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">Campbell Nash works with blue chip companies such as BP, Wood MacKenzie and Petrofac along with Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays from the Financial Services Sector. Director James Armstrong says: “Christmas is traditionally a time of partying and exchanging gifts with clients but this year could see the first major case under the UK Bribery Act that carries with it stricter new laws playing out across all sectors and none more so than oil and gas.”</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">Ernst and Young recently revealed that this particular sector has faced the most completed prosecutions for bribery and corruption in Britain over the past four years.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">Of 26 completed cases since 2008 the sector made up almost one fifth of all prosecutions. Behind oil and gas in the list are medical goods, insurance, and engineering and construction.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">Campbell Nash’s Armstrong adds: “Oil and gas is a particularly high risk sector as it operates across a range of difficult political environments where bribery can be endemic, and across a range of cultural environments where giving and accepting gifts is the norm.”</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">“Also, so-called facilitation payments, often made to expedite bureaucratic actions, remain illegal under the new act.”</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">Joint ventures continue to be a feature of the sector, involving oil and gas businesses, foreign governments and state owned entities, and carry with them corruption risks.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">Back to Armstrong; “The festive period is a time when one’s defences can be down, so beware accepting that tantalisingly innocent looking case of whisky. It might seem like a good idea at the time, but it could come back to haunt you!”</p>

<p class="BasicParagraph"><strong>Abbot Group Limited – Case Summary</strong></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">Scottish oil services provider, Abbot Group Limited, has become the first corporation to be penalised under the bribery and corruption self-reporting initiative, invoked as part of the UK Bribery Act 2010.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">The company has recently been fined £5.6m after admitting to benefitting from a series of corrupt payments made between one of its subsidiaries and an overseas oil and gas company.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">The following key criteria were considered before sending this case for extra-judicial settlement:-</p>
<ul>
<li>the nature and seriousness of the offence and the extent of the harm caused;</li>
<li>whether the business had in place adequate anti-bribery systems at the time of the criminal conduct and whether it has further addressed this following the conduct;</li>
<li>the extent of the wrongdoing within the business, including whether the conduct was authorised by, or connived in, by senior management, or restricted to a small number of lower-ranking individuals;</li>
<li>whether it is clear that the business is taking action as soon as the matter comes to the attention of senior management (as opposed to taking no action until it becomes aware that there is a risk that the conduct is going to come to light);</li>
<li>whether the business (or the individuals involved in the matter reported) has any previous record for this type of conduct. This would go beyond a previous criminal conviction, and would include any regulatory enforcement action or warning;</li>
<li>whether the individuals involved in the wrongdoing have left the business and, where decisions were taken at Board level, whether there is a new Board in place, and in both cases the timing and reasons for the departure of these individuals;</li>
<li>whether the business has honoured its commitment to engage with the Crown meaningfully and in particular to disclose the full extent of the wrongdoing;</li>
<li>whether there are particular considerations which may weigh against prosecution, such as the consequences of prosecution for the company’s employees and stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
<p class="BasicParagraph">Solicitor General Lesley Thomson QC said: “The self-reporting initiative creates a mechanism for businesses to recognise their corporate responsibility and take a rigorous approach to the investigation and elimination of such practices. While consideration must first be given to prosecution of appropriate cases, I am pleased that the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and the Civil Recovery Unit are committed to taking effective steps to ensure that businesses face up to their responsibilities and relinquish any unlawfully obtained profits.”</p>
<p>This case shows that the authorities will deal with these matters swiftly and in such a way to ensure that companies do not benefit from the proceeds of crime.</p>]]></uBlogsyContentBody>
